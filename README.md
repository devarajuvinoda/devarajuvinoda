Currently I'm working on my own startup, building next gen AI powered news application. Before this, I was a Member of the Technical Staff at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), where I was part of the Speech AI team. I completed my masterâ€™s in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru and also worked as a graduate student researcher at Stoch LAB. I finished my bachelorâ€™s degree from National Institute of Technology (NITK), Surathkal.

My research work mainly involves developing efficient machine learning algorithms to solve interesting problems in natural language/text analysis and robotics.

I also have keen interest in following areas; Natural language processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Deep reinforcement learning, Data mining, Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Robotics and Distributed Systems.
