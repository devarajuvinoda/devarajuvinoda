Iâ€™m Devaraju Vinoda, currently pursuing my masterâ€™s in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. Iâ€™ve been working as a graduate student researcher at Stoch LAB since Jan-2021. I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree from National Institute of Technology (NITK), Surathkal and before joining masterâ€™s I worked at Oracle as developer.

My research work mainly involves developing efficient machine learning algorithms to solve interesting problems in natural language/text analysis and robotics.

I also have keen interest in following areas; Natural language processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Deep reinforcement learning, Data mining, Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Robotics and Distributed Systems.
